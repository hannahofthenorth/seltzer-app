# seltzer

A new Flutter project.

## To Do
Finish implementing likes + comments

Ability to follow other users

Button to edit your profile pic, if you're looking at your profile

Require unique usernames

## Help Needed

ListView within Column

/lib/screens/user_profile_screen.dart

Ideally, I want this to look like the seltzer_feed_screen, where there's a  row of buttons with navigaiton options pinned to the bottom of the screen. 



Logout

/lib/screens/seltzer_feed_screen/

/lib/main.dart

I moved the logout button from the main drawer to the appbar on this screen because logging out while on your profile wasn't working, but now it still doesn't work sometimes.
I'm attempting to manage being logged in/out in main.dart but it's not redirecting me to the AuthScreen as expected sometimes.



## Done

Ability to search for other users

Ability to view other users' profiles
